# ESP32 IMU Pan-Tilt Control

This repo contains the code for my ESP32-based wireless panâ€“tilt servo control project.  
The system uses an MPU6050 IMU to measure orientation on one ESP32 (the **sender**) and reproduces that orientation with a panâ€“tilt servo mount on another ESP32 (the **receiver**) via ESP-NOW.

For a full write-up with wiring diagrams, photos, latency measurements, and demo videos, check out the blog post here: ðŸ‘‰ [Wireless Servo Control with Motion](https://open.substack.com/pub/hsinhungw/p/wireless-servo-control-with-motion?r=2tujdw&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false)

## Directories

- **sender-imu** â€“ Reads orientation data from the MPU6050 and sends it to the receiver over ESP-NOW.  
- **receiver-servo** â€“ Receives orientation data and drives the panâ€“tilt servos through a PCA9685 servo driver.

## Notes

Some values in the code (like `SERVOMIN`, `SERVOMAX`, and offsets) are based on my hardware and calibration.  
You should adjust these for your own setup.
